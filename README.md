# Machine Learning Projects

This repository contains 3 practical Machine Learning projects, showcasing skills in Python, data preprocessing, modeling, and evaluation. Each project is organized in its own folder for clarity.

## Projects Included

### 1. Neural Network for Regression
- Built a neural network using TensorFlow/Keras.
- Predicted outcomes based on input features.
- Implemented training, validation, and performance evaluation.
- [Project Folder: Neural_Network](./Neural_Network)

### 2. Employee Turnover Prediction
- Developed a classification model to predict employee attrition.
- Handled categorical and numerical features.
- Evaluated model using accuracy, classification report, and confusion matrix.
- [Project Folder: Employee_Turnover](./Employee_Turnover)

### 3. Fraudulent Transaction Detection
- Built a Random Forest classifier to detect fraud.
- Handled class imbalance using SMOTE.
- Evaluated model with accuracy, precision, recall, and F1-score.
- [Project Folder: Fraudulent_Transactions](./Fraudulent_Transactions)

## Requirements
- Python 3.10+
- Libraries: `pandas`, `numpy`, `scikit-learn`, `tensorflow` (for NN), `imblearn` (for SMOTE), `matplotlib`

Install dependencies using:

```bash
pip install -r requirements.txt
